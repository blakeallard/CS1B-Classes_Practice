Project Overview:
This program simulates the functionality of musical instruments, specifically Drums and Guitar. It utilizes object-oriented programming principles, such as classes and methods, to model the cost and specifications of these musical instruments. The program sets and displays the specifications and costs for each instrument, demonstrating basic class usage and data manipulation in C++.

Key Features:
Drums Class: Manages the specifications and cost for drums, including setting and displaying values.

Guitar Class: Manages the specifications and cost for guitars, similar to the drums class.

Classes and Objects: Demonstrates the use of classes to model real-world objects and their behavior.

Encapsulation: Uses methods to set and display attributes for both the drum and guitar objects, keeping the internal data safe from external manipulation.

Header and CPP Files: Each class has a corresponding header and cpp file for the definition and implementation of methods.

Skills Demonstrated:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding and implementation of classes and objects.

Encapsulation: Controlling access to class data through public methods.

File Organization: Dividing code into header files (.h) and implementation files (.cpp) for better readability and maintainability.

Data Representation: Storing and managing the cost and specifications of instruments using member variables.

Files Included:
Drums.h – Header file defining the Drums class.

Drums.cpp – Implementation file defining the methods for the Drums class.

Guitar.h – Header file defining the Guitar class.

Guitar.cpp – Implementation file defining the methods for the Guitar class.

main.cpp – Main file that demonstrates creating and manipulating objects of the Drums and Guitar classes.
